**Program Design Purpose**: We want to create a PLC simulator which can let the user to draw ladder diagram, then simulate the PLC's physical reaction (digital in/out) when loaded the ladder logic in the PLC, it also provide the ModBus-TCP interface for other module to read the current PLC state and do the control. [It is a under going project, not finished yet!]
